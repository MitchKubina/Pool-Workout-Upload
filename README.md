# Pool-Workout-Upload
A full stack application allowing users to upload their swim workouts for others to see

To Run this program, you must have node installed. From there, cd into the /client and /server folder

In /client, run the frontend via `npm start`

In /server, run the backend via `npm run dev`

From there, the application will run.

Inspiration: While there are websites out there for sharing swim workouts, I did not feel that there was one with an easy way for users to upload their workouts and share their ideas. Because of this, I built this.

Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS
